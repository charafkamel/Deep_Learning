## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of our **Deep Learning Mini-Project** for EE-559 at EPFL. The project focuses on **fostering safer online spaces** by developing deep learning models that detect hate speech in various formats, including text, images, memes, videos, and audio content.

## Objectives
- Develop deep learning models that accurately classify hate speech while minimizing false positives.
- Evaluate model performance with benchmarks and interpretability metrics.
- Address ethical and legal considerations in AI-powered content moderation.

## Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/deep-learning-project.git
   cd deep-learning-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional)
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training includes **text, images, and audio** related to hate speech detection.
- Preprocessing steps include **tokenization, augmentation, and feature extraction**.

## Model Architecture
- **Multi-modal deep learning models** integrating **transformers, CNNs, and RNNs**.
- **Transfer learning** is used with pre-trained models such as **BERT, CLIP, and ResNet**.
- Regularization techniques to mitigate bias and improve generalization.

## Training
To train the model, use:
```sh
python scripts/train.py --config config.yaml
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate model performance:
```sh
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth
```
